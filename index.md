## What is Caribbean Tech Forum?

We're all about connecting Caribbean IT professionals and developers across industry spectrums and skill levels.

From students to experts we aim to be an inclusive group for all. Whether you are in the Caribbean, or located outside the region as part of the Caribbean diaspora, all are welcome to come learn from each other and share their experiences!
